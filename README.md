# playtoearn
A Solidity smart contract for a Play-to-Earn game. Players accumulate scores and earn rewards in Ether once they reach a predefined threshold. The contract allows the owner to update scores, set reward thresholds, and deposit rewards for players.
This project is a demonstration of blockchain technology and smart contract integration.
